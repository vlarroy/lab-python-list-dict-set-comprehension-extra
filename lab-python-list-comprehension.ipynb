    "Hint: If you're having trouble writing a solution using a comprehension, try writing it out in a more traditional way first. This can help you break the problem down into smaller steps and better understand what you need to do. Once you have a working solution, you can then try to transform it into a comprehension if desired. Comprehensions can often be more concise and readable, but it's important to prioritize clarity and correctness over brevity."
